# Image Sources (Math 290)

This assignment was completed as part of Chris Tralie's *excellent* 3D geometry class (CS/Math 290) taught at Duke University in Spring 2016.

The assignment is concerned with introducing undergraduates to acoustic simulations. 3D transformations are used to simulate "echos" in simple scenographs using webGL. The assignment builds on top of Tralie's 3D geometry framework designed for teaching by adding several algorithms for computing image sources and for a sound source and generating the paths from the source to the receiver.
